        <h1>About</h1>
				<p>My passion for computers started at an early age. I was young and impressionable, growing up in the city of Rovno, Ukraine. My family wasn't well off but we got by. We didn't have much access to technology then but some of it managed to slip past the border. In the early 90s was the first time I laid eyes on a computer. It was a friend's birthday and a couple of friends and I were invited over. We spent most of our times playing games on his computer. Who knew then that this machine will play an important role in my life.</p>

				<p>When I was about nine years old, my family moved to the United States. I was living in Ellensburg, Washington at the time with my mom, when a friend of her's gifted me an old computer. I was thrilled, this was my first personal computer. It was an ancient machine, I forgot what model it was. I just remeber it ran DOS and I had to type commands in order to load the programs I wanted to use. I can still clearly see all those games. So many adventure games, space invaders clones, branches of pong and tetris. Seeing these games made me remember that day when I was at my friends house in Ukraine. I appreciated that moment because I locked that memory away for safe keeping. To be rediscovered much later, at a time when I was much older. You know, just one of those moments that help shape your future self.</p>
        <h2>A glimpse into web development</h2>
				<p>Years later, I'm living in New York City. I'm using a more powerful computer as a testament to Moore's Law. My friends and I start building websites on geocities and angelfire. A collection of images on a page - the kids at school love them. At the time I didn't know how important these experiments with early html, css, and javascript were. Have to give props to <a href="http://lissaexplains.com/">Lissa</a> for helping me start.</p>
				<p>Then I shifted interests, like all kids tend to do. I moved on to the next thing. The knowledge learned sealed itself under layers of other experiences until around the time I got to senior year of high school and started to consider the possibilty of studying graphic design or some kind of art program.</p>

				<p>I used photoshop to make random and often times cheesy graphics. Lens flare was so hot at the time. I used flash to make funny cartoons, at least funny at the time. Since I was sharing my computer time with my brother (very good system now that I think back on it, although I hated it at the time) I started drawing to kill time between my brother's computer sessions. I made a ton of comics and this made consider getting an art degree. I decided to make up my mind once I got to college.</p>
				<h2>Studying graphic &amp; web design</h2>
				<p>There were classes on print and digital design but mainly focused on graphic design geared toward print. I decided to study web design by applying the skills learned in my classes. This was around the time I met a friend who made websites in photoshop and sold the design online. We started talking about how mascots were trendy and everyone had one or wanted one on their site. I still think that could apply today with a well placed mascot that matches your brand name.</p>
				<p>So as I went through my regular design classes I started learning, or re-learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript all over again. Except this time it was from a more mature lens. At first it started with photoshop mockups. I tried translating my designs into actual working websites. This was new and challenging work and I scoured all over the interent for any kind of tutorial or example I could find to try and make my websites. It was after I finished translating the mockups into static html and css that I began tinkering with JavaScript and this is where my love and hate story with JavaScript began.</p>
