        <h1>About</h1>
				<p>My passion for computers started at an early age. I was young and impressionable, growing up in the city of Rovno, Ukraine. My family wasn't well off but we got by. We didn't have much access to technology then but some of it managed to slip past the border. In the early 90s was the first time I laid eyes on a computer. It was a friend's birthday and a couple of friends and I were invited over. We spent most of our times playing games on his computer. Who knew then that this machine will play an important role in my life.</p>

				<p>When I was about nine years old, my family moved to the United States. I was living in Ellensburg, Washington at the time with my mom, when a friend of her's gifted me an old computer. I was thrilled, this was my first personal computer. It was an ancient machine, I forgot what model it was. I just remeber it ran DOS and I had to type commands in order to load the programs I wanted to use. I can still clearly see all those games. So many adventure games, space invaders clones, branches of pong and tetris. Seeing these games made me remember that day when I was at my friends house in Ukraine. I appreciated that moment because I locked that memory away for safe keeping. To be rediscovered much later, at a time when I was much older. You know, just one of those moments that help shape your future self.</p>
        <h2>A glimpse into web development</h2>
				<p>Years later, I'm living in New York City. I'm using a more powerful computer as a testament to Moore's Law. My friends and I start building websites on geocities and angelfire. A collection of images on a page - the kids at school love them. At the time I didn't know how important these experiments with early html, css, and javascript were. All thanks to <a href="http://lissaexplains.com/">Lissa</a> for helping me start.</p>
				<p>Then I shifted interests, like all kids tend to do. I moved on to the next thing. The knowledge learned sealed itself under layers of other experiences until around the time I got to senior year of high school and started to consider the possibilty of studying graphic design or some kind of art program.</p>
